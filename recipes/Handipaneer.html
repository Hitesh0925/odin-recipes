    <p>Handi paneer is a traditional Indian dish consisting of paneer and creamy gravy cooked in a handi, a shallow Indian pot with a wide bottom. The gravy is made with cashews, ghee, onions, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, yogurt, and a variety of herbs and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, turmeric, garam masala powder, and fenugreek leaves.</p>
