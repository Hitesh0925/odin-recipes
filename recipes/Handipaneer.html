    <p>Handi paneer is a traditional Indian dish consisting of paneer and creamy gravy cooked in a handi, a shallow Indian pot with a wide bottom. The gravy is made with cashews, ghee, onions, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, yogurt, and a variety of herbs and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, turmeric, garam masala powder, and fenugreek leaves.</p>
    <p>The gravy is prepared first, while the paneer is added near the end of cooking. This spicy curry is usually served with piping hot parathas, butter naan, or rice on the side. If desired, it can be garnished with chopped coriander leaves.</p>
